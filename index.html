        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Website</h2>
        <p>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript form the backbone of front-end web development, each technology bringing something unique to the table to produce engaging, user-friendly websites. HTML provides the fundamental structure—defining the layout of text, images, links, and other elements—much like a blueprint for a house. CSS then handles the aesthetics, allowing developers to adjust fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment, ensuring that each element is presented in a visually appealing manner. Bootstrap, which originated as an internal tool at Twitter, streamlines this styling process by offering a comprehensive set of pre-built components—like buttons, forms, and navigation bars—along with a responsive grid system that adapts content to various screen sizes.       Meanwhile, JavaScript injects interactivity and dynamic features into the page, enabling things like dropdown menus, form validation, real-time data updates, and animated effects. In my opinion, these four pillars are indispensable for anyone seeking to create modern and scalable web experiences, as they ensure that websites look polished, function smoothly, and remain accessible to a wide range of users. Interestingly, HTML has evolved significantly since its initial version in 1991, now supporting semantic elements, multimedia tags, and more—highlighting just how far the web has come in a few decades. Equally noteworthy is that JavaScript, originally created in just 10 days in 1995, has grown into one of the most widely adopted programming languages in the world, powering interactivity on the majority of the internet’s websites. Moreover, Bootstrap’s responsive design philosophy reflects our mobile-first era, emphasizing the importance of catering to users on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and beyond. By learning how these technologies interconnect, you gain the ability to craft seamless, visually captivating, and highly functional websites—a skill set that is more in demand now than ever before.</p>
